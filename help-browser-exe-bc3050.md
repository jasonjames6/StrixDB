help-browser.exe is an executable file associated with GIMP, a popular open-source image manipulation software developed by The GIMP Development Team, specifically for version 2.10.12.0. It is primarily used to facilitate the help browser feature within the GIMP application, providing users with access to documentation and support resources. Generally, help-browser.exe is considered safe, as it is a legitimate component of the GIMP software and not a virus or malware. However, like any software, it may occasionally encounter errors, which can manifest as issues with launching the help documentation or causing GIMP to freeze or crash. Users are advised to ensure that they have downloaded GIMP from official sources to avoid counterfeit versions that could potentially contain harmful files masquerading as help-browser.exe.
