gtk-query-immodules-2.0.exe is an executable file associated with the Pidgin messaging application, specifically version 2.12.0, and is published under an open-source license. This file is part of the GTK (GIMP Toolkit) framework, which Pidgin relies on for its graphical user interface and input method modules. Generally, gtk-query-immodules-2.0.exe is considered safe if it originates from the official Pidgin installation and not from an unverified source, as it is a legitimate component of the software. However, users may encounter errors related to this executable if it becomes corrupted or if there are issues with the installation of Pidgin itself. In some cases, antivirus software might flag it as a potential threat due to its executable nature, but this is often a false positive, particularly if the software is downloaded from reputable sources. It is always advisable to ensure that your security software is up to date and to verify the integrity of the application to avoid any potential risks.
